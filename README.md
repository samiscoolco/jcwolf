# jcwolf

A reimplementation of Wolfenstein 3d using the original games files. Including a soft documentation of run length encoding and Carmac encoding for future reference.

Intenteded to be written with simple easy functions that run in a single file and can easily be ported to other languages.

Languages I would like to make a port in
C (base)
Python
Java
JS
Go


my compile string
gcc main.c -o jcwolf.exe -Iinclude -Llib -lraylib -lgdi32 -lwinmm

just add all wl6 game files next to your exe and youre good to go!
